# 📦 Advance Text Compression Tool — Huffman vs LZ77

A web-based tool for compressing text using **Huffman Coding** and **LZ77** algorithms. It visualizes the Huffman Tree, displays character-to-code mappings, and compares the performance of both algorithms using graphical charts.

> 🎯 Built as a project for the Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) course.
